Attributes to weigh the severity of an accident are 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND' and 'LIGHTCOND'.The Original dataset have many unwanted variables and values to make the dataset fit for analysis, Dataset has to be preprocessed and cleansed. Post processing the data we will used to train the machine learning model."
